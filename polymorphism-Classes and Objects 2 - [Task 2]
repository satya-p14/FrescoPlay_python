#1. Define a class 'rectangle' with two methods 'display' and 'area'.
# Define the method 'display' such that it will Print the message "This is a Rectangle" upon calling.
#Define the method 'area' which takes 2 parameters 'Length' and 'Breadth' and find the area of the rectangle and Print as "Area of Rectangle is 144".
#2. Define a class 'square' with two methods 'display' and 'area'.
# Define the method 'display' such that it will Print the message "This is a Square" upon calling 
#Define the method 'area' which takes a single parameter 'Side' and find the area of the square and Print as "Area of square is 169".
